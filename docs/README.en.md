The management script includes a built-in function for requesting an `SSL certificate` via `Cloudflare`. To obtain the certificate using this script, you need:


<details> 
    <summary> ⚙️ Expand description </summary>

- An email registered with `Cloudflare`
- Cloudflare Global API Key
- The domain name must be directed (set in DNS) to the current server via `Cloudflare`



## How to get a Cloudflare Global API Key:

1. In the terminal, run the command `x-ui`, then select `Cloudflare SSL Certificate`.

2. Go to the link: [Cloudflare API Tokens](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens)

3. Click `View Global API Key` (see screenshot below):
