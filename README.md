## SSL Certificate

<details>
    <summary>Click for SSL Certificate details</summary>

### Cloudflare

The management script includes a built-in SSL certificate application for Cloudflare. To use this script to apply for a certificate, you need the following:

- Cloudflare registered email
- Cloudflare Global API Key
- The domain name must be resolved to the current server through Cloudflare

**How to get the Cloudflare Global API Key:**

1. Run the `x-ui` command in the terminal, then choose `Cloudflare SSL Certificate`.
2. Visit the link: [Cloudflare API Tokens](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens).
3. Click on "View Global API Key" (see the screenshot below):

4. You may need to re-authenticate your account. After that, the API Key will be shown (see the screenshot below):
   ![](media/APIKey2.png)

When using, just enter your `domain name`, `email`, and `API KEY`. The diagram is as follows:
